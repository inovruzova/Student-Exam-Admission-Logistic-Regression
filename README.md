This project focuses on building a binary classification model using logistic regression to predict student admission outcomes based on two exam scores. The project includes:

- Data loading and normalization (Min-Max scaling)
- -vData visualization with color-coded exam outcomes
- Logistic regression implementation from scratch using gradient descent
- Cost function analysis and convergence plotting
- Model testing on training data and specific examples
- Logistic regression using scikit-learn for comparison
- A report summarizing all findings and performance results

The goal is to train a classifier that predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on their scores in two exams.
